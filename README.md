A new kind of Linux for ARM.


Hi, my name is Matt Walker,
I am a part time tech hobbyist who enjoys playing with all sorts of electronics,
from a 1980's Heathkit HERO-1 Robot to modern smartphones. My current projects include the 
PiBook G4, a 9000 lumen homemade flashlight, and of course SunflowerOS, a Linux distro built 
specifically for ARM/RISC-V devices.
